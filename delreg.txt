How to delete registry subkeys and values by using a registration entries (.reg) file?


RESOLUTION


To delete a registry path with all the subkeys or a single subkey from the registry using a reg file, use a hyphen (-) before the registry path to delete the complete path, or after the equal sign fro subkey to delete a single subkey.

 

Sample registry path with subkeys:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test]

"testkey1"=dword:00000004

"testkey2"="testkey"

 

To delete a registry path with all the subkeys, put a hyphen (-) in from of the registry path in the .reg file.

[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test]

 

To delete a single subkey put a hyphen (-) after the equals sign following the DataItemName in the .reg file.

For example to delete "testkey1" add a hyphen (-) after the equal sign for "testkey1":

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Test]

"testkey1"=-
