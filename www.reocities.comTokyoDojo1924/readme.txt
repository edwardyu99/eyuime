Introduction
------------
MP3 Quality Modifier is a straightforward program that is able to
easily change the quality of your MP3's in order to save disk space
and/or to fit more music on your MP3 player while maintaining the
desired level of audio quality and keeping all ID3 tags intact!

The program is pretty simple to use: The first step is to drag and
drop MP3 files or playlists on the file list, MP1 and MP2 files are
supported as well. Various information such as the name, interpret,
size and bitrate are displayed automatically.
The next step is to select a preset which ranges from high quality
over portable and compromise to low quality. More advanced users can
choose from a variety of configurations such as bitrate mode and rate,
sample frequency and the stereo modus.
The process itself takes only a few seconds per song and is even able
to adapt the folder structure if that is wanted. Unlike other
programs all ID3 tags like the title, artist etc. are automatically
retained as well.
Finally the result window allows to compare the original and created 
usic files by listing their size differences.
